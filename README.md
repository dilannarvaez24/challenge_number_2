Below you`ll find a little recap on how to run same code in different interfaces like the Windows Terminal, Git and Virtual Studio Code (VSC). 

# ðŸŒ EXECUTING SAME CODE IN DIFFERENT INTERFACESðŸŒ : 

As a second challenge, I was involved into a little piece of the coding world and in order to start on it the teacher provides us with some tools with the instruction os test it and make sure everything looks good and literally running smoothly. The tools were basic, and the code is simple than two lines:

/// 

if __name__ == "__main__" :
  print("Hola mundo")
///

youÂ´ll find it below:

### ðŸ’»GITðŸ’»

This is a tool that works as an interpreter and allow us to run different code connected to different coding languages like Python. With that in mind, you can see in the image below how does it looks and works:
