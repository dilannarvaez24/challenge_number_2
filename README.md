Below you`ll find a little recap on how to run same code in different interfaces like the Windows Terminal, Git and Virtual Studio Code (VSC). 

# 🌠EXECUTING SAME CODE IN DIFFERENT INTERFACES🌠: 

As a second challenge, I was involved into a little piece of the coding world and in order to start on it the teacher provides us with some tools with the instruction os test it and make sure everything looks good and literally running smoothly. The tools were basic, and the code is simple than two lines as below:

```
if __name__ == "__main__" :
  print("Hola mundo")
``` 

### 💻GIT💻

This is a tool that works as an interpreter and allow us to run different code connected to different coding languages like Python. With that in mind, you can see in the image below how does it looks and works:

### 🖥️WINDOWS TERMINAL🖥️

In the same way, the idea is to execute the same piece of code but now running it in tje Windows terminal that will be activated by applying the comand:````Win + r
